                <p>
                    My name is Kimberly, and I'm a freshman at UW, planning to major in Informatics. What drew me to Informatics is its incredible interdisciplinary natureâ€”combining technology, design, and human interaction in a way that directly impacts our world.<br><br>
                    I am a founder of a media team so I use the internet as a tool to amplify underrepresented voices. I'm also a dog person!! I dedicated myself to charitable works by protecting stray animals back in China.
